## Ferris draw
- An educational tool aimed to teach the basics of programming to children.

### Project
- This project was originally an [Imagine Logo](https://imagine.input.sk/international.html) port to rust.
- The reason I am creating this project is because I had a ton of fun with it when I was in elemntary school learning about this.

### Project Features
- The project uses [lua](https://www.lua.org/) as its programming language, with [mlua](https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua).
- You can import any library in your script, as the [lua](https://www.lua.org/) instance to support external libraries.
- The drawings are rendered with the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/), to ensure flexibility, safety and speed.
- Ui components are created via [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui).
- You can run scripts by utilizing the scripts tab but you can run quick commands via the Command Panel available in the application.
- The Command Panel has the user friendly interface with features to enhance production.
- You can also save and open projects.

### Drawing Capabilities
- Create multiple drawers (with a unique ID).
- Draw lines forward and backward.
- Rotate the drawer to left and right.
